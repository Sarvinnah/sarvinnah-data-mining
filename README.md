The research aims to provide actionable insights by utilizing the capabilities of SAS Enterprise Miner, Talend Data Integration, and Talend Data Preparation. Predicting customer churn help companies navigate the digital marketplace are the main goals.

2.0	Objectives
This case study's main goal is to use SAS Enterprise Miner to analyze an integrated e-commerce dataset in-depth, with a particular emphasis on churn prediction and customer behavior analysis. The research attempts to get actionable insights that can guide strategic decision-making for companies involved in the digital marketplace using sophisticated analytics approaches.

3.0 Role of SAS e-miner, Talend Data Integration and Data preparation
Throughout this analysis, there are several tools that were integrated to get an accurate result by the end of this study. This section explains roles of each tool that were used:
3.1	Jupyter Notebook
The main tool used in this case study to create a synthetic dataset using the Faker package was Jupyter Notebook. Python scripts were run to take use of Jupiterâ€™s interactive and iterative features and use Faker's capabilities to create a realistic and varied e-commerce dataset. This synthetic dataset was enhanced with fictitious but realistic consumer traits, and it was essential in validating and improving data cleaning algorithms and expanding the source dataset for a more thorough examination of e-commerce customer behavior. The smooth integration of the Faker library was made possible by the Jupyter Notebook environment, which enhanced the dataset production process's efficiency and transparency relative to the larger analytical goals.

3.2	Data Talend Integration
The customer information file and the customer behavior file are two crucial datasets that were merged in this case study, and Talend Data Integration was crucial in making this happen. The integration process was carefully planned to bring information from these many sources together in a smooth manner, making use of Talend's strong capabilities. While the customer behavior file offered insights into past purchases and preferences, the customer details file included basic information like membership credentials and demographics. The mapping and modification of data fields was made easier by Talend's user-friendly graphical interface, which guaranteed a standardized and unified dataset. The case study aimed to provide a complete dataset that encompasses consumer traits and behavior through the implementation of this integration methodology. The logs produced throughout the integration process are an invaluable tool that guarantees the integrity of the combined dataset, reveals information about the merging procedures, and identifies any irregularities. This combined dataset provides a consolidated picture of consumer data for thorough e-commerce behavior analysis, which is crucial for further studies in SAS Enterprise Miner.

3.3	Talend Data Preparation
Within the framework of this case study, Talend Data Preparation was important in improving the comprehension of the dataset. A thorough examination of the dataset was carried out using Talend Data Preparation to learn more about its composition, caliber, and possible areas for development. The interactive and visual data exploration made possible by the platform's user-friendly interface allowed for a deeper look at certain qualities, distribution patterns, and the existence of missing information. Talend Data Preparation made it easier to find and deal with outliers, inconsistent data, and missing data, which improved the overall quality of the data. The summary statistics and visualizations that were produced gave the analyst a detailed understanding of the dataset and enabled them to decide on the best preprocessing and data cleaning techniques. The goal of the case study was to guarantee that the future analysis in SAS Enterprise Miner is based on a strong foundation of well-understood and well-prepared data by utilizing Talend Data Preparation for a thorough examination.

3.4	SAS Enterprise Miner
SAS Enterprise Miner was essential to the thorough examination of the e-commerce dataset in this case study. One of the most important steps in data preparation was filling in the missing values, which the platform helped with. To properly handle missing data, the case study made use of sophisticated methodologies and SAS's strong capabilities. In addition, a decision tree model was developed using SAS Enterprise Miner, which offered insights into the variables affecting consumer behavior. The investigation was extended to incorporate ensemble methods employing the Random Forest algorithm, including Bagging and Boosting. By using an ensemble technique, the models' prediction ability was increased, which strengthened our understanding of customer behavior. Ultimately, SAS Enterprise Miner functioned as the analytical engine for analyzing the data and drawing significant business conclusions. The platform's toolkit enabled a thorough examination of the dataset, aiding in the process of making decisions regarding the behavior of online shoppers.
